ECE368 Advanced Digital Design Lab
================
Welcome to the ECE368 Lab Repository.

This repository contains setup instructions, VHDL examples, Lab assignments and the Final Project for ECE368. ECE368 is an Advanced Digital Design Course focusing on VHDL with a FPGA.

### Lab Requirements:
* Nexyx 2 Development Board
* ISE WebPack 14.7
* Group with a classmate(2-3 per group)

### Lab Code
The lab code that was provided for each lab is designed as a learning mechanism. The code has issue's on purpose and its up to you to find the issues. Solution for the code for each lab will be handed out upon request after the completion of the lab assignment.

### Hardware

The course will focus primary on Digilent's [Nexysâ„¢2 Spartan-3E FPGA Board](http://www.digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?Prod=NEXYS2) as a learning tool.

### Software

The course will use Xilinx's [14.7 ISE WebPack Edition](http://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/design-tools.html). The webpack edition is free to download and use. But first you have to register on their site to download it and obtain a webpack license.
